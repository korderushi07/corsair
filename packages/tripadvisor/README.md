## Auth

Auth: API key sent in the `X-API-Key` header.

## Search modes

Define the search area with a center (`location_id` or `lat` + `lon`) plus a positive `radius`, or with all four bounding-box coordinates (a bounding box alone is sufficient). Results support category, rating, locale, pagination, and sorting filters. Telemetry logs filter values and result counts only, never search coordinates.

## Notes

- Awards are embedded in `location.details` (`awards[]`); Terra exposes no standalone awards endpoint.
- Geo hierarchy ancestors come from `geo.details` (`hierarchy.ancestors`); Terra exposes no children-listing endpoint.
- Nearby hotels: call `locations.nearby` with `category: 'HOTEL'` and a small `size` (e.g. 10).
- Terra exposes no bookable-activities endpoint, so it is intentionally absent.

## Webhooks

No webhooks. The Tripadvisor Terra API reference does not define a webhook contract for these read endpoints.
